The histones form a disk-shaped complex called a nucleosome, which contains two complete turns of double-stranded DNA wrapped around its surface. These non-specific interactions are formed through basic residues in the histones, making ionic bonds to the acidic sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA, and are thus largely independent of the base sequence.

Haldane and Fisher argued that, because mutation is a weak pressure easily overcome by selection, tendencies of mutation would be ineffectual except under conditions of neutral evolution or extraordinarily high mutation rates. This opposing-pressures argument was long used to dismiss the possibility of internal tendencies in evolution, until the molecular era prompted renewed interest in neutral evolution.\nNoboru Sueoka and Ernst Freese proposed that systematic biases in mutation might be responsible for systematic differences in genomic GC composition between species. The identification of a GC-biased E. coli mutator strain in 1967, along with the proposal of the neutral theory, established the plausibility of mutational explanations for molecular patterns, which are now common in the molecular evolution literature.\nFor instance, mutation biases are frequently invoked in models of codon usage. Such models also include effects of selection, following the mutation-selection-drift model, which allows both for mutation biases and differential selection based on effects on translation.

Additionally, certain regions of DNA, such as those that code for proteins, are more prone to mutations than non-coding regions. Mutation bias plays a key role in shaping the genetic diversity of populations and the course of evolution. By introducing new genetic variants, mutations provide the raw material for natural selection to act upon, allowing populations to adapt to changing environments.

He viewed this as the outcome of a coevolutionary race, writing that "there has been a race in gaining length between the nectary of the Angræcum and the proboscis of certain moths". This wastefulness is familiar in modern terms as the idea of an evolutionary arms race, but was disturbing to biologists of the time who believed that adaptations were the outcome of benevolent divine purpose.Darwin described "the most remarkable of all Orchids", Catasetum, and showed how in these flowers, "as throughout nature, pre-existing structures and capacities [had been] utilised for new purposes". He explained the mechanism in which the pollen masses of the pollinium were connected by a bent stalk or pedicel to a sticky disc kept moist at the back of the flower. When an insect touched an "antenna" projecting from the back of the flower, this released the bent pedicel which sprang straight and fired the pollinium, sticky disc first, at the insect. In experiments, Darwin had imitated this action using a whalebone spring.

These orchids require specialized care and attention, and proper fertilisation is essential for their growth and health. Exotic orchids have unique fertilisation requirements and often rely on specific insects or birds for pollination, making them particularly vulnerable to environmental disturbances. Careful attention must be given to the selection of fertilisers for these orchids, as improper fertilisation can lead to undernutrition or overfertilisation that can harm these delicate plants.

Alternatives supported by biologists at other times included structuralism, Georges Cuvier's teleological but non-evolutionary functionalism, and vitalism.\nTheistic evolution was the idea that God intervened in the process of evolution, to guide it in such a way that the living world could still be considered to be designed. The term was promoted by Charles Darwin's greatest American advocate Asa Gray. However, this idea gradually fell out of favor among scientists, as they became more and more committed to the idea of methodological naturalism and came to believe that direct appeals to supernatural involvement were scientifically unproductive. By 1900, theistic evolution had largely disappeared from professional scientific discussions, although it retained a strong popular following.In the late 19th century, the term neo-Lamarckism came to be associated with the position of naturalists who viewed the inheritance of acquired characteristics as the most important evolutionary mechanism.

However, this theory was largely discredited after extensive experimentation failed to find evidence of it. Other alternatives include orthogenesis, which suggested that organisms evolved in a predetermined direction and could not deviate from this path, as well as mutationism, which held that genetic mutations were the sole driving force behind evolution.

The biological information contained in an organism is encoded in its DNA or RNA. Most organisms use DNA, but many viruses have RNA as their genetic material. The DNA or RNA of viruses consists of either a single strand or a double helix.Viruses can reproduce rapidly because they have relatively few genes. For example, influenza virus has only eight genes and rotavirus has eleven. In comparison, humans have 20,000–25,000. Some viral genes contain the code to make the structural proteins that form the virus particle. Other genes make non-structural proteins found only in the cells the virus infects.All cells, and many viruses, produce proteins that are enzymes that drive chemical reactions. Some of these enzymes, called DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase, make new copies of DNA and RNA. A virus's polymerase enzymes are often much more efficient at making DNA and RNA than the equivalent enzymes of the host cells, but viral RNA polymerase enzymes are error-prone, causing RNA viruses to mutate and form new strains.In some species of RNA virus, the genes are not on a continuous molecule of RNA, but are separated.

All amino acids are synthesized from intermediates in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, or the pentose phosphate pathway. Nitrogen is provided by glutamate and glutamine. Nonessensial amino acid synthesis depends on the formation of the appropriate alpha-keto acid, which is then transaminated to form an amino acid.Amino acids are made into proteins by being joined in a chain of peptide bonds. Each different protein has a unique sequence of amino acid residues: this is its primary structure. Just as the letters of the alphabet can be combined to form an almost endless variety of words, amino acids can be linked in varying sequences to form a huge variety of proteins. Proteins are made from amino acids that have been activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA precursor is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase.

Grooming—in the form of fur-combing—is generally considered the primary function and original role of the lemuriform toothcomb, and subsequent changes in morphology across multiple lineages have altered its function and obscured its original function.The hypothesis that the toothcomb evolved for food procurement was based on observations of recent lemuriform taxa, such as cheirogaleid lemurs (particularly fork-marked lemurs and the hairy-eared dwarf lemur) and galagos, which demonstrate tooth-scraping of plant exudates, as well as sifakas, which practice bark-prising. Each of these were considered "primitive" forms among the living strepsirrhines, suggesting the first lemuriforms exhibited similar behaviors.

If feeding ecology could have such profound effects on the shape of the anterior de', 'gpt': 'The lemuriform toothcomb is a specialized dental arrangement in lemurs and lorises that is composed of forward-projecting lower incisors and canines that are set apart from the rest of the teeth by a diastema. This unique structure serves as a grooming tool, allowing the lemurs and lorises to comb their dense fur and remove debris such as parasites and dirt. The comb-like teeth are also important in feeding behaviors, as they are used to strip leaves and bark to access nutrients. The original function of the lemuriform toothcomb is believed to have evolved as an adaptation to the arboreal lifestyle of these primates, where grooming and food acquisition can be challenging.  Overall, the toothcomb is a key morphological feature of lemurs and lorises, and provides valuable insights into their evolutionary history and biology.', 'randNum': 1},
    {'title': 'Virus', 'subsection': 'Baltimore classification', 'wiki': 'The Nobel Prize-winning biologist David Baltimore devised the Baltimore classification system. The ICTV classification system is used in conjunction with the Baltimore classification system in modern virus classification.The Baltimore classification of viruses is based on the mechanism of mRNA production. Viruses must generate mRNAs from their genomes to produce proteins and replicate themselves, but different mechanisms are used to achieve this in each virus family. Viral genomes may be single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds), RNA or DNA, and may or may not use reverse transcriptase (RT). In addition, ssRNA viruses may be either sense (+) or antisense (−). This classification places viruses into seven groups:\n\nI: dsDNA viruses (e.g. Adenoviruses, Herpesviruses, Poxviruses)\nII: ssDNA viruses (+ strand or "sense") DNA (e.g. Parvoviruses)\nIII: dsRNA viruses (e.g. Reoviruses)\nIV:(+)ssRNA viruses (+ strand or sense) RNA (e.g. Coronaviruses, Picornaviruses, Togaviruses)\nV: (−)ssRNA viruses (− strand or antisense) RNA (e.g. Orthomyxoviruses, Rhabdoviruses)\nVI: ssRNA-RT viruses (+ strand or sense) RNA with DNA intermediate in life-cycle (e.g. Retroviruses)\nVII: dsDNA-RT viruses DNA with RNA intermediate in life-cycle (e.g. Hepadnaviruses)', 'gpt': 'The Baltimore classification system is a method used to categorize viruses based on their genetic material and replication strategy. This system was proposed by Nobel laureate David Baltimore in 1971 and has become a widely used standard in the field of virology. It groups viruses into seven classes based on their nucleic acid type, and the presence or absence of reverse transcriptase (an enzyme that synthesizes DNA from RNA). Class I includes double-stranded DNA viruses, Class II contains single-stranded DNA viruses, Class III has double-stranded RNA viruses, Class IV is single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses, Class V contains single-stranded negative-sense RNA viruses, Class VI has single-stranded RNA retroviruses, and Class VII contains double-stranded DNA pararetroviruses. The Baltimore classification system has helped researchers understand the diversity of viruses and develop treatments for viral diseases.', 'randNum': 0},
    {'title': 'Wells and Wellington affair', 'subsection': 'Legacy', 'wiki': "In 2001, the American herpetologist John Iverson, and the Australian herpetologists Scott Thomson and Arthur Georges evaluated the changes proposed by Wells and Wellington to Australian turtles and found that just three of them represented available names. In 2017, the Turtle Taxonomy Working Group recognised one subgeneric, one specific, and one subspecific name originally proposed by the duo as being valid senior synonyms among the world's turtle taxa. A 2020 update of the Reptile Database indicated that 23 specific names for reptiles first published in the Australian Journal of Herpetology papers were recognised as valid senior synonyms at the time: sixteen lizards (including three geckos), six snakes and one turtle. One amphibian, the northern corroboree frog (Pseudophryne pengilleyi), also retains a specific name assigned by the pair. Additionally, several generic names proposed by Wells and Wellington have been accepted and used by subsequent researchers.Although Wells and Wellington indicated that they intended to write reassessments of fish in Australia, reptiles in Papua New Guinea and global herpetological taxa similar to their three papers in the Australian Journal of Herpetology, Wells withdrew somewhat from the world of academic herpetology after the affair. He and Wellington republished several of their Australian Journal of Herpetology descriptions, some with slight changes, in the following decades. The first instance of this was apparently in the Australian H", 'gpt': "The legacy of the Wells and Wellington affair remains a cautionary tale for those in positions of power. It exposed the corrupt and unethical actions of some high-ranking officials and highlighted the importance of journalistic investigation and public scrutiny. The scandal led to the establishment of regulations and procedures to prevent similar abuses of power, such as stricter lobbying rules and improved transparency measures. It also contributed to the growing demand for accountability and ethics in government and the media. The Wells and Wellington affair has had a lasting impact on the public's view of those in authority and the need for transparency and integrity in public life.", 'randNum': 1},
