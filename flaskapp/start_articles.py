These proteins are ubiquitinated by SCFTIR1, or SCF in complex with the auxin receptor TIR1. Degradation of Aux/IAA proteins derepresses transcription factors in the auxin-response factor (ARF) family and induces ARF-directed gene expression. The cellular consequences of ARF activation depend on the plant type and developmental stage, but are involved in directing growth in roots and leaf veins. The specific response to ARF derepression is thought to be mediated by specificity in the pairing of individual ARF and Aux/IAA proteins.', 'gpt': 'The proteasome also plays a crucial role in regulating plant growth. It is involved in the degradation of key signaling proteins that control processes such as cell division and differentiation. In addition, the proteasome helps to regulate the levels of phytohormones, such as auxins, cytokinins, and gibberellins, which also impact plant growth and development. Researchers have found that manipulating the activity of the proteasome can have important effects on plant growth, such as increasing fruit size, improving stress tolerance, and enhancing overall yield. Therefore, understanding how the proteasome functions in the context of plant growth is an area of active research with potential applications in agricultural and horticultural settings.', 'randNum': 1}, {'title': 'Introduction to viruses', 'subsection': 'Protein synthesis', 'wiki': "Proteins are essential to life. Cells produce new protein molecules from amino acid building blocks based on information coded in DNA. Each type of protein is a specialist that usually only performs one function, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein. Viruses force the cell to make new proteins that the cell does not need, but are needed for the virus to reproduce. Protein synthesis consists of two major steps: transcription and translation.Transcription is the process where information in DNA, called the genetic code, is used to produce RNA copies called messenger RNA (mRNA). These migrate through the cell and carry the code to ribosomes where it is used to make proteins. This is called translation because the protein's amino acid structure is determined by the mRNA's code. Information is hence translated from the language of nucleic acids to the language of amino acids.Some nucleic acids of RNA viruses function directly as mRNA without further modification. For this reason, these viruses are called positive-sense RNA viruses. In other RNA viruses, the RNA is a complementary copy of mRNA and these viruses rely on the cell's or their own enzyme to make mRNA. These are called negative-sense RNA viruses. In viruses made from DNA, the method of mRNA production is similar to that of the cell. The species of viruses called retroviruses behave completely differently: they have RNA, but inside the host cell a DNA copy of their RNA is made with the help o", 'gpt': "During protein synthesis, viruses use the host cell's machinery to produce viral proteins, which are essential for viral replication. Most viruses have two types of proteins: structural proteins, which make up the viral particle, and non-structural proteins, which are involved in viral replication. The process of protein synthesis begins with the translation of viral mRNA on ribosomes, which assemble amino acids into a long chain. This chain then folds into a functional protein with the help of chaperone proteins. In some cases, the viral protein may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation or phosphorylation, to become fully functional. However, some viruses have developed strategies to evade the host cell's protein synthesis machinery or even to hijack it to produce their own proteins at the expense of the host cell's normal functions. Understanding the intricacies of viral protein synthesis is crucial for developing effective antiviral therapies.", 'randNum': 0}, {'title': 'Archaea', 'subsection': 'Relationship to bacteria', 'wiki': "The relationships among the three domains are of central importance for understanding the origin of life. Most of the metabolic pathways, which are the object of the majority of an organism's genes, are common between Archaea and Bacteria, while most genes involved in genome expression are common between Archaea and Eukarya. Within prokaryotes, archaeal cell structure is most similar to that of gram-positive bacteria, largely because both have a single lipid bilayer and usually contain a thick sacculus (exoskeleton) of varying chemical composition. In some phylogenetic trees based upon different gene/protein sequences of prokaryotic homologs, the archaeal homologs are more closely related to those of gram-positive bacteria. Archaea and gram-positive bacteria also share conserved indels in a number of important proteins, such as Hsp70 and glutamine synthetase I; but the phylogeny of these genes was interpreted to reveal interdomain gene transfer, and might not reflect the organismal relationship(s).It has been proposed that the archaea evolved from gram-positive bacteria in response to antibiotic selection pressure. This is suggested by the observation that archaea are resistant to a wide variety of antibiotics that are produced primarily by gram-positive bacteria, and that these antibiotics act primarily on the genes that distinguish archaea from bacteria. The proposal is that the selective pressure towards resistance generated by the gram-positive antibiotics was eventually ", 'gpt': 'Archaea have often been regarded as bacteria due to their similarities in size and shape, as well as their prokaryotic nature. However, they are distinct from bacteria in many ways. One of the most significant differences is that archaeal cell walls lack peptidoglycan, which is present in bacterial cell walls but not in eukaryotic cells. Additionally, there are differences in the lipid composition of their cell membranes. The membranes of most bacteria contain fatty acids attached to glycerol, while archaeal membranes contain ether linkages between glycerol and hydrocarbon chains that contain branched isoprenes. Another notable difference between archaea and bacteria is their genetic makeup, as archaea possess unique genes that are not found in bacteria or eukaryotic organisms. Therefore, despite their similarities to bacteria, archaea are a distinct group of organisms with their own distinctive characteristics.', 'randNum': 0}, {'title': 'Fauna of Scotland', 'subsection': 'Passerines', 'wiki': "Ravens are typically forest-dwelling birds in much of Europe, but in Scotland they are generally associated with mountains and sea coasts. In 2002 the hooded crow was recognised as a separate species from the carrion crow. Scotland and Northern Ireland host all of the approximately 190,000 UK territories of the former. A recent survey suggest that raven numbers are increasing but that hooded crows had declined by 59% while carrion crow numbers were essentially static.

Ring ouzels have declined to around 7,000 pairs, possibly due to disturbance from the growing number of human visitors to their upland habitat. There are fewer than 100 breeding pairs of snow bunting, although in winter they are joined by migrants from continental Europe. A nest site near Dumfries is thought to have been in use by dippers since 1881. Scotland has 95% of the British breeding population of red-listed twite, about 64,000 pairs.

The male and female Scottish Crossbills have distinctly different beaks that allow them to feed primarily on pine seeds.

They are all clustered together, arrayed side by side across 1.92 megabases of DNA on chromosome 4. The 21 functional genes have been divided into two sub-classes based on position and sequence similarity: 6 peripheral Class A Mups and 15 central Class B Mups. The central Class B Mup gene cluster formed through a number of sequential duplications from one of the Class A Mups. As all the Class B genes are almost identical to each other, researchers have concluded that these duplications occurred very recently in mouse evolution. Indeed, the repetitive structure of these central Mup genes means they are likely to be unstable and may vary in number among wild mice. The Class A Mups are more different from each other and are therefore likely to be more stable, older genes, but what, if any, functional differences the classes have are unknown. The similarity between the genes makes the region difficult to study using current DNA sequencing technology. Consequently, the Mup gene cluster is one of the few parts of the mouse whole genome sequence with gaps remaining, and further genes may remain undiscovered.Rat urine also contains homologous urinary proteins; although they were originally given a different name, α2u-globulins, they have since become known as rat Mups.

These proteins are secreted in the urine and can be detected by other rodents through their sense of smell. The MUPs of rodents have a high degree of genetic diversity, with many different genes coding for different MUPs. This diversity is thought to be due to selective pressure from predators and competitors, as well as sexual selection. Males have a higher number of MUPs than females, and they also produce larger quantities of these proteins. MUPs play an important role in rodent communication and may also have other functions, such as regulating water balance in the body.', 'randNum': 0}, {'title': 'Preening', 'subsection': 'Etymology', 'wiki': 'The use of the word preen to mean the tidying of a bird\'s feathers dates from Late Middle English. It appears to be a variant of the word prune; one now-obsolete definition of prune meant "anoint", based on the Latin ungere, which had the same meaning. This usage was combined with the Scottish and northern English dialect preen meaning "pierce" or "pin", due to the "pricking" action of the bird\'s beak during preening.', 'gpt': 'The term "preening" comes from the behavior of birds in maintaining their feathers. It is thought to derive from the Middle English word "prennen," meaning to pluck or pick, which is in turn derived from the Old English word "prynan." This behavior is essential for birds to remove dirt and parasites from their feathers, to distribute oils from their preen gland, and for social bonding. The concept of preening has also come to be applied to human grooming behaviors, such as smoothing hair or adjusting clothing.', 'randNum': 0}, {'title': 'Preening', 'subsection': 'Importance', 'wiki': "Preening is a maintenance behaviour used by all birds to care for their feathers. It is an innate behaviour; birds are born knowing the basics, but there is a learned component. Birds that are hand-reared without access to a role model have abnormalities in their preening behaviours. Despite spending considerable time in their efforts, they do not use proper techniques to groom effectively and may do a poor job overall as a result. Displaced feathers can cause birds considerable trouble; such feathers might become damaged, could interrupt the smooth flow of air over a flying bird, or might allow the bird's body heat to escape. Preening allows a bird to reposition such displaced feathers. There is evidence that filoplumes, specialised feathers buried under a bird's outer covering of contour feathers, help to signal when contour feathers have been displaced. Mechanoreceptors at the base of the filoplumes only fire when contour feathers are displaced or the filoplume moves. Preening enables birds to remove dirt and parasites from their plumage, and assists in the waterproofing of feathers. During moult, birds remove the sheaths from around their emerging pin feathers while preening.Because feathers are critical to a bird's survival – contributing to insulation, waterproofing and aerodynamic flight – birds spend a great deal of time maintaining them. When resting, birds may preen at least once an hour. Studies on multiple species have shown that they spend an average of more than", 'gpt': "Preening is a vital aspect of bird behavior that helps maintain their overall health and survival. It involves the use of the bill, tongue, and oil glands to clean, condition and arrange their feathers. Birds need to preen to maintain their feathers' structural integrity, insulation properties, and waterproofing. Proper preening also helps birds remove parasites and dirt, maintain their body temperature, and engage in courtship behavior. Additionally, preening allows birds to spread oil from their preen gland onto their feathers, which helps to water-resist them. Without preening, birds' feathers would break down, become brittle, and effectively impair their ability to fly and thermoregulate. Thus, preening plays a crucial role in avian biology, allowing birds to thrive in their environment.", 'randNum': 1}, {'title': 'Flight feather', 'subsection': 'Delayed development in hoatzins', 'wiki': 'The development of the remiges (and alulae) of nestling hoatzins is much delayed compared to the development of these feathers in other young birds, presumably because young hoatzins are equipped with claws on their first two digits.
