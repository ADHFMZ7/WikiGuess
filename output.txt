"In 1995, NATO launched its first ever military operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The operation, named Operation Deliberate Force, was a response to the ethnic conflict and violence that had erupted in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the breakup of Yugoslavia.\n\nThe conflict began in 1992, when Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence from Yugoslavia. The country's Serb population, supported by the Yugoslav People's Army, resisted the new government and began a campaign of ethnic cleansing against Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) and Croat populations. The conflict led to widespread violence, displacement, and human rights violations.\n\nIn response to the escalating crisis, the United Nations Security Council passed several resolutions mandating a cease-fire and authorizing the deployment of peacekeeping forces to the region. However, these efforts proved ineffective in stopping the violence, as the warring parties continued to violate the cease-fire and engage in attacks against civilians.\n\nIn August 1995, NATO launched Operation Deliberate Force, a series of air strikes against Bosnian Serb military targets. The air strikes were intended to compel the Bosnian Serbs to comply with UN resolutions and cease their attacks on civilian populations. Over the course of the operation, NATO bombed over 400 targets, including command and control centers, munitions depots, and air defenses.\n\nThe operation was controversial, with some arguing that it exceeded NATO's authority and undermined the UN peacekeeping mission. However, others argued that it was necessary to prevent further bloodshed and protect civilians from the atrocities being committed by the Bosnian Serbs.\n\nUltimately, the operation succeeded in its objectives, and the Bosnian Serbs were forced to negotiate a peace agreement. The Dayton Accords, signed in December 1995, brought an end to the conflict and established Bosnia and Herzegovina as a multi-ethnic state.\n\nThe NATO intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina was a turning point in the alliance's history, marking its first use of military force outside of its traditional defense role. It paved the way for future NATO interventions in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and other regions."
